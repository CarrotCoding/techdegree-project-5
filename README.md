This is the final project of the Team Treehouse Techdegree

Within the project you are shown a website that I've made my own. HTML and CSS
courtesy of Team Treehouse. In this I've applied templating, created a db and
uploaded my previous projects using the Flask framework combined with
Flask-SQLalchemy.

To get it to work locally:
- Download the project files from my github
- Set up a virtual environment within the project file
- Install the frameworks found in requirements.txt

When you've done the above steps you can run the application with
- Python3 app.py (Mac)
- Python app.py (Windows)

Afterwards you can go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser and navigate
The website! Enjoy!
